# Week 4: Systems of Equations

## Learning Objectives
- Solve systems of linear equations using multiple methods
- Understand consistent, inconsistent, and dependent systems
- Apply systems to real-world scenarios
- Work with systems of inequalities

## Topics Covered

### 1. Solution Methods
- Graphing method
- Substitution method
- Elimination method
- Matrix methods (introduction)

### 2. Types of Systems
- Consistent systems (one solution)
- Inconsistent systems (no solution)
- Dependent systems (infinite solutions)
- Three-variable systems

### 3. Applications
- Mixture problems
- Break-even analysis
- Supply and demand
- Linear programming basics

## Practice Problems

1. Solve: x + y = 5 and 2x - y = 1
2. Solve using elimination: 3x + 2y = 12 and 5x - 2y = 4
3. Determine if the system is consistent: x + y = 3 and 2x + 2y = 5
