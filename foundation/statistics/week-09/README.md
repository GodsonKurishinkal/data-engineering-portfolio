# Week 9: Hypothesis Testing

## Learning Objectives
- Understand hypothesis testing framework
- Conduct one-sample and two-sample tests
- Interpret p-values and significance levels
- Avoid common errors in hypothesis testing

## Topics Covered

### 1. Hypothesis Testing Basics
- Null and alternative hypotheses
- Type I and Type II errors
- Significance level (α)
- Power of a test

### 2. One-Sample Tests
- z-test for mean
- t-test for mean
- Test for proportion
- One-tailed vs. two-tailed tests

### 3. Two-Sample Tests
- Independent samples t-test
- Paired samples t-test
- Two-proportion z-test
- Assumptions and conditions

## Practice Problems

1. Test H₀: μ = 50 vs. Hₐ: μ ≠ 50 with sample mean=52, s=8, n=36, α=0.05
2. Before: [10, 12, 15, 14, 13]; After: [12, 13, 16, 15, 14]. Test if training improved scores
3. Interpret: "p-value = 0.03 at α = 0.05"
