# Week 6: Probability Distributions - Continuous

## Learning Objectives
- Understand continuous probability distributions
- Work with normal distribution
- Use z-scores and standard normal table
- Apply uniform and exponential distributions

## Topics Covered

### 1. Continuous Random Variables
- Probability density function (PDF)
- Area under the curve
- Expected value and variance
- Cumulative distribution function

### 2. Normal Distribution
- Properties of normal distribution
- Standard normal distribution (z-scores)
- Empirical rule (68-95-99.7)
- Central Limit Theorem introduction

### 3. Other Continuous Distributions
- Uniform distribution
- Exponential distribution
- Applications in data engineering

## Practice Problems

1. X ~ N(100, 15). Find P(X < 115)
2. Convert to z-score: X = 85, μ = 100, σ = 15
3. According to empirical rule, what percentage of data falls within 2 standard deviations?
