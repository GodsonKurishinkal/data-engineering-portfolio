# Week 10: Correlation and Regression

## Learning Objectives
- Measure correlation between variables
- Understand simple linear regression
- Interpret regression output
- Assess model fit and assumptions

## Topics Covered

### 1. Correlation
- Pearson correlation coefficient
- Spearman rank correlation
- Correlation vs. causation
- Correlation matrices

### 2. Simple Linear Regression
- Least squares method
- Regression equation: ŷ = b₀ + b₁x
- Slope and intercept interpretation
- Predictions and extrapolation

### 3. Regression Analysis
- R² (coefficient of determination)
- Residual analysis
- Regression assumptions
- Standard error of estimate

## Practice Problems

1. Calculate correlation coefficient for: X=[1,2,3,4,5], Y=[2,4,5,4,5]
2. Given regression equation ŷ = 10 + 2x, predict y when x = 5
3. If R² = 0.81, what percentage of variance is explained by the model?
