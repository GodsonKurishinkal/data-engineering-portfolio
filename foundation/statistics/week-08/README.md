# Week 8: Confidence Intervals

## Learning Objectives
- Construct and interpret confidence intervals
- Understand confidence levels
- Calculate intervals for means and proportions
- Determine appropriate sample sizes

## Topics Covered

### 1. Confidence Interval Basics
- Point estimates vs. interval estimates
- Margin of error
- Confidence level interpretation
- Common confidence levels (90%, 95%, 99%)

### 2. CI for Population Mean
- z-interval (known σ)
- t-interval (unknown σ)
- t-distribution properties
- Assumptions and conditions

### 3. CI for Population Proportion
- Proportion interval formula
- Sample size requirements
- Success-failure condition
- Wilson score interval

## Practice Problems

1. Sample mean=50, s=8, n=36. Construct a 95% confidence interval for μ
2. In a survey, 60 out of 100 support a proposal. Find 95% CI for the population proportion
3. What sample size is needed for a margin of error of 2 with 95% confidence, σ=10?

## Resources
- CI calculators
