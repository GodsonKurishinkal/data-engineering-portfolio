# Week 5: Probability Distributions - Discrete

## Learning Objectives
- Understand discrete probability distributions
- Work with binomial and Poisson distributions
- Calculate expected value and variance
- Apply distributions to data problems

## Topics Covered

### 1. Discrete Random Variables
- Probability mass function (PMF)
- Expected value (mean)
- Variance of discrete distributions
- Cumulative distribution function (CDF)

### 2. Binomial Distribution
- Conditions for binomial distribution
- Binomial probability formula
- Mean and variance
- Applications (success/failure scenarios)

### 3. Poisson Distribution
- Poisson process
- Poisson probability formula
- Mean and variance (λ)
- Applications (rare events, arrivals)

## Practice Problems

1. Flip a coin 10 times. What's the probability of exactly 6 heads?
2. On average, 3 customers arrive per hour. What's the probability of exactly 5 customers in an hour?
3. Calculate E(X) and Var(X) for a binomial distribution with n=20, p=0.3

## Resources
- Distribution calculators
- Real-world examples of distributions
