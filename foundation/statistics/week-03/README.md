# Week 3: Measures of Dispersion

## Learning Objectives
- Calculate range, variance, and standard deviation
- Understand the concept of spread in data
- Use coefficient of variation
- Apply dispersion measures to assess data quality

## Topics Covered

### 1. Range and Interquartile Range
- Range calculation
- Quartiles and percentiles
- Interquartile range (IQR)
- Box plots and outlier detection

### 2. Variance and Standard Deviation
- Population vs. sample variance
- Standard deviation formula
- Interpretation of spread
- Properties of variance

### 3. Coefficient of Variation
- Relative variability
- Comparing datasets with different units
- Applications in data engineering

## Practice Problems

1. Calculate variance and standard deviation: [5, 7, 8, 9, 11]
2. Find the IQR for: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15]
3. Which dataset has more relative variability: A (mean=50, SD=5) or B (mean=100, SD=8)?
