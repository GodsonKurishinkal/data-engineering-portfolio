# Week 2: Measures of Central Tendency

## Learning Objectives
- Calculate and interpret mean, median, and mode
- Understand when to use each measure
- Handle outliers and skewed data
- Apply measures to real datasets

## Topics Covered

### 1. Mean
- Arithmetic mean
- Weighted mean
- Geometric mean
- Properties and limitations

### 2. Median
- Calculating median
- Median for grouped data
- Robustness to outliers
- When to use median vs. mean

### 3. Mode
- Unimodal, bimodal, multimodal distributions
- Mode for categorical data
- Limitations of mode

## Practice Problems

1. Calculate mean, median, and mode: [2, 4, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10]
2. Dataset: [1, 2, 3, 4, 100]. Which measure of central tendency is most appropriate?
3. Find the weighted mean of test scores: 80 (weight 0.3), 90 (weight 0.5), 85 (weight 0.2)
