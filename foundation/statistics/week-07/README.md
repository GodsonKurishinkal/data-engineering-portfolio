# Week 7: Sampling Distributions and Central Limit Theorem

## Learning Objectives
- Understand sampling distributions
- Apply the Central Limit Theorem
- Calculate standard error
- Understand the distribution of sample means

## Topics Covered

### 1. Sampling Distributions
- Distribution of sample statistics
- Sampling distribution of the mean
- Sampling distribution of proportions
- Law of Large Numbers

### 2. Central Limit Theorem
- Statement and conditions
- Applications and implications
- Sample size considerations
- Non-normal populations

### 3. Standard Error
- Standard error of the mean
- Standard error of proportion
- Relationship to sample size
- Margin of error

## Practice Problems

1. Population: μ=50, σ=10. Sample size n=25. Find the mean and standard deviation of x̄
2. If sample size increases from 25 to 100, how does standard error change?
3. Sample of 100 from any distribution. What can we say about the distribution of x̄?
