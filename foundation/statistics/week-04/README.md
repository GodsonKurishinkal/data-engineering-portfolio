# Week 4: Probability Fundamentals

## Learning Objectives
- Understand basic probability concepts
- Calculate probabilities using rules
- Work with conditional probability
- Apply Bayes' theorem

## Topics Covered

### 1. Probability Basics
- Sample space and events
- Probability axioms
- Addition rule
- Multiplication rule

### 2. Conditional Probability
- Definition and notation P(A|B)
- Independence
- Dependent events
- Tree diagrams

### 3. Bayes' Theorem
- Formula and derivation
- Prior and posterior probabilities
- Applications in machine learning
- Real-world examples

## Practice Problems

1. If P(A) = 0.3 and P(B) = 0.4, and A and B are independent, find P(A ∩ B)
2. A test is 95% accurate. If 1% of the population has a disease, what's the probability you have it given a positive test?
3. Two dice are rolled. What's the probability the sum is 7?
