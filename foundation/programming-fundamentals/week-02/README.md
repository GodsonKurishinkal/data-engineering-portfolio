# Week 2: Control Flow - Conditionals and Loops

## Learning Objectives
- Use conditional statements for decision making
- Implement loops for repetitive tasks
- Understand control flow concepts
- Handle different scenarios in code

## Topics Covered

### 1. Conditional Statements
- if, elif, else statements
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators (and, or, not)
- Nested conditionals

### 2. Loops
- for loops and range()
- while loops
- Loop control: break, continue, pass
- Nested loops

### 3. Iteration Patterns
- Iterating over sequences
- enumerate() and zip()
- List comprehensions (introduction)

## Practice Exercises

```python
# 1. Conditional example
temperature = 25
if temperature > 30:
    print("It's hot!")
elif temperature > 20:
    print("It's pleasant")
else:
    print("It's cold")

# 2. Loop examples
for i in range(5):
    print(f"Iteration {i}")

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(f"{num} is even")
```
